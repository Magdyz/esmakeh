Meaning (esmak = Name, eh = What's your) what's your name in Arabic.

A website in Arabic language that helps people find a name for their child in Arabic. The aim is to have a very clean minimalist page.

The website is build on with BootStrap. 

In the future I'm planning to host the website on a hosting platform because this is build purely on one page hosted by blogger at the moment.
